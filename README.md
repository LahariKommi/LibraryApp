Rooms can be booked using "Make Booking" and "Book Search" options present at the bottom of the screen.

Make Booking: Allows to quickly book a room by specifying the room number and time.Both options are mandatory
Room Search: Search results based on parameters like room number, location, time, size can be retrieved.

All other features are self-explanatory

When an admit deletes a room all the history associated with that room is deleted. So the user history doesn't contain the data of that room anymore.

When memeber is deleted by the admin, his bookings are deleted. Other members will be able to use the slots alloted to him.
